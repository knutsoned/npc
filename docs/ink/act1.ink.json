In the mean time, I happened to be holding this +1 Engineer's Hammer when our town exploded in a ball of green flame a moment ago. I can only use regular hammers and the smithy is in pretty rough shape, too rough to be used for storing enchanted hammers. Perhaps you can find a good home for it?\"","\n",["ev",{"^->":"The_Town.balltholemewWere.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Take the hammer",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"The_Town.balltholemewWere.0.3.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Politely decline",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"The_Town.balltholemewWere.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"The_Town.balltholemewTake"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"The_Town.balltholemewWere.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.3.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"The_Town.balltholemewTemp1"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"balltholemewIDon":[["^\"Balltholemew!

The Player (Balltholemew, Fischer, Minor, or Barderton) must collect enchanted or cursed items, which will be attractive to either the Hero or the Villain respectively.

If the Villain is ready for war and the Hero isn't, they will simply take over the town. Likewise, if the Hero regains strength while the Villain is still vulnerable, they will quickly dispatch the Villain and throw a wild party in the tavern which will be three times as destructive as the actual battle.
