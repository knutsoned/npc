The Player (Balltholemew, Fischer, Minor, or Barderton) must collect enchanted or cursed items, which will be attractive to either the Hero or the Villain respectively.

The Hero or Villain performing a quest may cause environmental effects like landslides and flooding. They may cause the next battle to be staged somewhere other than Overdown.","\n","^There may be other class-specific ways to tip the scales, but beware! If the Villain is ready for war and the Hero isn't, they will simply take over the town. Likewise, if the Hero regains strength while the Villain is still vulnerable, they will quickly dispatch the Villain and throw a wild party in the tavern which will be three times as destructive as the actual battle. The only ways to win are to successfully fortify the town before the next battle, or ensure it happens far, far away.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"global decl":["ev",false,{"VAR=":"talked_to_hero_guard"},false,{"VAR=":"ring_taken"},false,{"VAR=":"helm_taken"},false,{"VAR=":"sword_taken"},false,{"VAR=":"hammer_taken"},false,{"VAR=":"flute_taken"},false,{"VAR=":"talked_to_fisher"},false,{"VAR=":"talked_to_miner"},false,{"VAR=":"talked_to_bard"},false,{"VAR=":"visited_tower"},false,{"VAR=":"visited_camphero"},false,{"VAR=":"visited_mountains"},false,{"VAR=":"visited_forest"},false,{"VAR=":"visited_town"},false,{"VAR=":"visited_lake"},false,{"VAR=":"visited_campvillain"},false,{"VAR=":"visited_castle"},"/ev","end",null],"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
